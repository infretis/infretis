    Note:
        The swapping move for ensembles [0^-] and [0^+] requires some
        extra propagation. Here we are generating new paths for [0^-]
        and [0^+] in the following way:

        1) For [0^-] we take the initial point in [0^+] and integrate
           backward in time. This is merged with the second point in [0^+]
           to give the final path. The initial point in [0^+] starts to the
           left of the interface and the second point is on the right
           side - i.e., the path will cross the interface at the end points.
           If we let the last point in [0^+] be called `A_0` and the
           second last point `B`, and we let `A_1, A_2, ...` be the
           points on the backward trajectory generated from `A_0` then
           the final path will be made up of the points
           `[..., A_2, A_1, A_0, B]`. Here, `B` will be on the right
           side of the interface and the first point of the path will also
           be on the right side.

        2) For [0^+] we take the last point of [0^-] and use that as an
           initial point to generate a new trajectory for [0^+] by
           integration forward in time. We also include the second last
           point of the [0^-] trajectory which is on the left side of the
           interface. We let the second last point be `B` (this is on the
           left side of the interface), the last point `A_0` and the
           points generated from `A_0` we denote by `A_1, A_2, ...`.
           Then the resulting path will be `[B, A_0, A_1, A_2, ...]`.
           Here, `B` will be on the left side of the interface and the
           last point of the path will also be on the left side of the
           interface.
