## Introduction
∞RETIS is a Python library designed to facilitate Replica Exchange Transition Interface Sampling (RETIS).
∞RETIS interfaces with molecular dynamics (MD) programs such as
[GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org/), [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/), and [CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org/), offering researchers an
efficient and flexible tool for advanced simulations.

Our recent publication
[Highly Parallelizable Path Sampling with Minimal Rejections Using Asynchronous Replica Exchange and Infinite Swaps](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2318731121)
showcases the capabilities of ∞RETIS.
We are also in the process of preparing a detailed paper specifically about this software library.

## Features
- **Advanced Sampling Techniques**: Utilizes the [RETIS](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.268301) method
  and more specialized subtrajectory moves with high acceptance such as [Wire Fencing](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0127249) for
  efficient sampling of rare events in molecular simulations.
- **Parallel sampling**: Utilizes a [asynchronous replica exchange scheme for parallelization with infinite swapping](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.2c06004).
- **Seamless Integration**: Easy interfacing with popular MD programs like GROMACS, LAMMPS, and CP2K. Please see the [examples](#Examples).


## Installation
∞RETIS can be installed via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/infretis/):

```bash
pip install infretis
```

⚠️ **Note**: ∞RETIS does not manage the installation of external MD programs. Users are responsible for installing and configuring these programs independently.




## Examples

We have provided several examples to help you get started with ∞RETIS:

* [sugar puckering](/examples/gromacs/puckering/), which is an in-depth tutorial
* [chignolin unfolding](https://github.com/infretis/infentory/tree/main/chignolin)
* .. and much more available on the [infentory](https://github.com/infretis/infentory/) repository!
