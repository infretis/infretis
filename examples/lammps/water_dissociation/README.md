Water autoionization
</h1>

### TODO
* [x] reduce load path size
* [ ] upload to infentory
* [ ] make scripts for plotting?
* [x] make scripts for visualization
* [x] fix lammpstrj processor
* [x] fix xyz processor?
* [ ] also adapt puckering exercise for cosy; exactly the same as here but with gromacs. Only production md run and path sampling, then visualize
* [ ] move puckering and water dissociation README.md to infentory
* [ ] fix installation after moving to infentory
### Aloha üëã
In this session, we will study the autoionization of water using **path sampling**. The main outcomes of such a simulation allow us to

* calculate üñ•Ô∏è exactly how often a chemical reaction occurs
* and visualize üëÄ how this chemical reaction actually happens


To achieve this you are going to perform the following steps:
* 1Ô∏è‚É£ Perform a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#nogo) to equilibrate your system
* 2Ô∏è‚É£ Perform a path sampling simulation on this system with &infin;RETIS + LAMMPS
* 3Ô∏è‚É£ See and learn how water dissociates at the molecular scale üîé

### Step 0: Installation
Open a terminal.


If you don't already have conda or mamba:

```bash
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh -b
```

Close and then re-open the terminal. You should now see **(base)** in the lower left of your screen.

Download python and lammps:

```bash
mamba create --name cosy_24 python==3.11 lammps
```

Install infretis, and the exercise files.
```bash
mamba activate cosy_24
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/infretis/infretis.git@cosy_24
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/infretis/inftools.git@main
git clone https://github.com/infretis/infentory.git cosy_workshop
cd cosy_workshop/water_dissociation/lammps/
echo ========== We will perform the exercise from this folder ===============
```

### Step 1: MD with LAMMPS
Familiarize yourself with the files in the directory `lammps_input/`. Can you explain what these files contain?

Now, change to the `step1_md_run` directory and modify `lammp.input` to run an MD simulation at 300K for some femtoseconds - picoseconds with a 0.5 fs timestep. We want to analyze some of the output, so write output with reasonable frequency.

LAMMPS can be run with the command `lmp -i lammps.input`.

Does the system reach the desired temperature?

Animate the trajectory by opening the .dump file in Avogadro.

```bash
wget Avogadro¬†~/
chmod +x ~/Avogadro
~/Avogadro
```
Use the `animation` tool and check the `Dynamic bonding?` checkbox. Do you see anything interesting?

Investigate the value of the order parameter. It tells us whether we are in the reactant state (only water present), the product state (water with one OH- and one H3O+ present), or anything in between.

```bash
inft recalculate_order -toml infretis.toml -traj md_run.dump -format 'lammpsdump'
```

### Step 2: Path sampling with &infin;RETIS + LAMMPS

### Step 3: Analysis of the results
Interested reader: This is a reproduction of the work in cite pnas?

```bash
inft trjcat -out traj.pdb -traj trash/reactive/traj.txt -topology test_reaxff_water/initial.xyz -format lammpsdump -centersel "index 78"
inft trjcat -out traj.pdb -traj traj.txt -topology ../../../gromacs_input/topol.tpr -centersel "element C" -selection "index 0 to 15"
