Water autoionization
</h1>

### Aloha üëã
In this session, we will study the autoionization of water using **path sampling**. The main outcomes of such a simulation allow us to

* calculate üñ•Ô∏è exactly how often a chemical reaction occurs.
* visualize üëÄ how this chemical reaction actually happens


To achieve this you are going to perform the following steps:
* 1Ô∏è‚É£ Perform a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/#nogo) to equilibrate your system
* 2Ô∏è‚É£ Perform a path sampling simulation on this system with &infin;RETIS + LAMMPS
* 3Ô∏è‚É£ See and learn how water dissociates at the molecular scale

### Step 1: Equilibration with LAMMPS

### Step 2: Path sampling with &infin;RETIS

### Step 3: Analysis of the results
